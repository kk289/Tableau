Files: 

1. Training 

It is my first viz done in Tableau Public. I watched a youtube video (freeCodeCamp.org), and followed all steps to create a viz. The dataset file I used is training set (train.csv) which is from kaggle. (Link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It is fun to work on Tableau, and later, I will add more tableau projects in this repo.

2. Air Quality

It is 2nd viz done in Tableau Desktop (which is free for student and can get professional edition license for 1 year). The dataset is not very big. It is about the New YOrk air quality analysis, where I did correlation of temp with other variables.
