# Tableau

Files: 

1. Training 

It is my first viz done in Tableau Public. I watched a youtube video (freeCodeCamp.org), and followed all steps to create a viz. The dataset file I used is training set (train.csv) which is from kaggle. (Link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It is fun to work on Tableau, and later, I will add more tableau projects in this repo.
